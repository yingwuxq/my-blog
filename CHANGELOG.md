# Changelog

All notable changes to Quiet Pages will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Added a local SVG favicon and linked it from the shared document head.

### Changed

- Bumped the theme package version to `2.1.0`.
- Tuned homepage hero and post-card image output to reduce PageSpeed image-delivery savings while preserving responsive Astro image generation.
- Added `fetchpriority="high"` to the homepage LCP hero image.
- Updated default contact and newsletter form behavior so unconfigured static themes no longer ship `mailto:` form submissions; forms now fall back to same-site `GET` targets until HTTPS provider endpoints are configured.
- Updated README form guidance to document the empty default endpoints and recommended HTTPS provider setup.

### Fixed

- Fixed PageSpeed/Lighthouse best-practices warnings for `mailto:` form submissions.
- Fixed the LCP request discovery warning by explicitly prioritizing the eagerly loaded hero image.
- Improved small metadata link touch targets in post cards and featured content.
- Fixed the missing favicon request that caused a browser console 404 in Lighthouse.
